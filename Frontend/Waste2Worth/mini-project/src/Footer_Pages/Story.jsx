            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>It all started with a simple yet powerful ideaâ€”no one should go hungry. 
                Founded in 2015, our food donation organization began as a small community initiative. 
                Over the years, we have partnered with restaurants, farmers, and individuals 
                to rescue surplus food and distribute it to those in need.</p>
